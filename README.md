# T3SP
Software used in "Resource-driven disease dynamics: linking resources, traits, trophic cascades, and instability using loop analysis"

Dynamica file (included here) needed to find hopf and fold bifurcations in the Mathematica scripts. The import links in the Mathematica notebooks must be changed to the location of the Dynamica file. A tutorial for the package can be found at the creator's (Randall Beer) website: https://rdbeer.pages.iu.edu/ 

LCE file needed for analysis of the chaotic attractor in variant 3. The LCE package (and lce.m file) can be found at the creator's (Marco Sandri) website: https://www.msandri.it/soft.html

Code for generating Fig. 1 - 3, 4 - 6, and A1 - A2 are each in their own notebook. 

MatCont session/data used to generate LPC and period doubling curves for variant 3 can be found in T3SP_MatCont folder.
